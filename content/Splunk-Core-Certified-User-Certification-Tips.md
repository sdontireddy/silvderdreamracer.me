I’m happy to share with you all that i have successfully completed Splunk Core Certified User certification. My personal take on the exam.

-  My background i have been using Splunk at job for day today activities, so if you have experience with Splunk then complexity level is easy.
-  However if you are starting a fresh would recommend to complete all the labs mentioned in the training and thoroughly practice commands mentioned below
-  And pay special attentions to the Context Menus on each of the different screens
-  Take a notes of best practices mentioned in the Splunk Fundamental 1 training course
-  Providing some quick refresher topics and highlighting some of the areas that i haven’t payed attention and had to spend little more time answering them carefully during the exam.

Please use this as a quick guide to the topics that you would need to pay attention while preparing for SPLUNK core certified User .

My intention is not to give all the questions and answers that i got in the exam but to give you quick idea on some minor details we often dont pay attention while performing SPLUNK labs or even with day-today activities with SPLUNK.
